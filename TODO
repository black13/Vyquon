Bugs:

1. SymbolEq() compares a symbol to a string. This is wrong... symbols should be interned. Also, in the compiler, we should refer to 
the SYMBOLS 'if and 'while and etc, not to their strings... Solution is to intern symbols and change SymbolEq to check memory address locs.

2. The Instruction structure uses a VyObj to store associated data, even though it often isn't one. This should be changed to a union,
so the code can accurately reflect the type of data being used.

3. Nil() should be able to return either '() or 'nil. Does the current implementation allow that? Check by locally changing the return type of Nil()
and then experimenting with various uses of it.

Future Development:
  - Garbage Collector
  - Increase # of bytecode instruction types  (to reduce average overhead)
  - JIT instead of bytecode
